# DiskCleaner

A lightweight Go project designed to efficiently traverse files and folders, and finding duplicate files.

Unlike conventional methods which are quite slow, this program first identifies similarities, drastically reducing processing time.
This optimization enables seamless execution even within environments like NSA.

Next steps are:
* Add probability of file being duplicate
* Introduce GUI with an ability to show list of duplicates, remove duplicate, and preview of the file and its duplicates
